This is an implementation of a solver in "A well-balanced scheme for the shallow water equations with topography" by
Michel-Dansac, Berthon, Clain & Foucher. The implementation is my own and therefore so are any issues with the solution.

In the terminal:

To run -> ipython main.py				# Runs the solver and outputs the h and hu data

       -> ipython plot_curve_data.py 	# Outputs an animation for h and hu over the space-time solution domain.
